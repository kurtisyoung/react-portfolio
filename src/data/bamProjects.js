  The biggest challenge for this project was the tight deadline we had to meet. We were able to finish the website on time and within the budget because we had a good system in place. We used Github branches to minimize merge conflicts and Vue allowed us to work quickly and efficiently, giving us time to create a dynamic experience for users.`,

  <br/> 
  This was one of my favourite projects that I've worked on. The layout, design and feel of the website is exactly what I look for in other websites. Every page interacts with the user in a different way. It makes the user curious and keeps them guessing. That's what I love about coding. There are endless ways you can be creative.`,
